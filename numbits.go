// numbits is an alternative binary representation of float64 numbers.
// float64 are stored as (sign | exponent | mantissa)
// with 1 bit sign, 11 bits exponent, 52 bits mantissa
// They can be represented as [8]byte or as string and can be created from
// these representations.
// All possible float64 values are representable as numbits.
// numbits were implemented by Arne Hormann for Quamina; he later discovered
// that an equivalent representation was used long ago in the disk format of DB2.
//
// Arne's implementation carefully handled NaN, -0, and infinities, but
// Quamina ignores those issues because a combination of JSON rules and
// Quamina's parsers prevent those values from occurring.
